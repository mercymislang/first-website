    <h2>My Take on Music</h2>

        <p>
            As an introvert, I find it hard to openly express myself. I truly believe in Hans Christian Andersen quote, "Where words fail, music speaks".
            I will open my ears to various genres of music, however, depending on my mood or whatever task I may be doing, it dictates the genre of music
            I would listen to. For example, when I am feeling all SAD GIRL, you'll catch me listening to my Moody Mix Spotify playlist. If I could, I would
            want a theme song to play whenever I do something like what you see in movies or tv shows. Picture me in a scene where I just tanked up my gas, and
            then cue music "Shut Up and Drive" by Rihanna would be playing as I drive away. Life is more fun with music.

    <h2>Go To Genre: 2000s Hip-Hop & R&B</h2>

    <p>
        In my opinion, music nowadays, are more about sampling other great records instead of originality. Yes, it may be a way for established artists
        to maintain their popularity by adapting to the current popular trends of mainstream music. For example, we have a newcomer, Summer Walker, sampled Usher's You Make Me Wanna song,
        on her track Come Thru with some changes to the mix. BUt in my opinion, the original was better. Another example, take Elton John. He recently re-released his Cold Heart song
        featuring Dua Lipa that resulted in a more pop-mix song compared to the original. If I had to identify myself with a music genre, it would be 2000s R&B.

        <h2>Music and Productivity</h2>

        <p>
           I don't care what anyone says, but there is a link to productivity and music. Speaking from experience, if I am doing a repetitive task for an entire shift,
           it feels less mundane if I am listening to music. It keeps me motivated to want to work and distracts me from constantly looking at the time that is excruciatingly slow.
           It doesn't have to be work-related. If I'm at the gym listening to EDM, I know for a fact I'll push myself to add another set or rep to my usual 10 sets of 3 reps.
           Music motivates my productivity.
